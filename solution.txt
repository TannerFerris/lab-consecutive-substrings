There are two for loops with the variables 'i' for the outher loop and 'j' for the inner loop. The outer loop is used 
for the starting position of the slice, and the j is used for the second position of the slice. 

The input string is "abc". So the index positions are: "(a,0),(b,1),(c,2)"

So as the first loop passes 'i' is set to 0, and j is set to '1' since it is "i + 1".

the length of the input string ("abc") is 3.

The first slice is "a" since it starts at i which is index 0 and end at j which is index 1.

Second is "ab" with i = 0 and j = 2;

Third is "abc" with i=0 and j = 3; It can reach 3 because the for condition is set to j <= string.length which is 3.

The inner loop is finished and therefore the outerloop runs again starting at i = 1, which is the second position.

The second position is "b". So you get "b", "bc", and then j is at 3.

The outer loop runs a third time which reaches its max since it is set to i < string.length.

The inner loop starts at "c" since i = 2 and there are no consecutive letters so the loop is finished.
